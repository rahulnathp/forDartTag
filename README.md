# FIBUNACCI PROGRAM
## 1. Running project
### Stable environment


This program helps to find the n th position value in the fibonacci series by providing the value of n  ,  example if we provide the value of n as 8  the result will be 21.

#### 1.1. Setup



1. Install packages

```$ npm i``` or ```$ npm install```



#### 1.2. Running
```$ npm run  start``` or ```$ npm run fibonacci```


#### 1.3  Program logic

Using the Fibonacci Recursive Function: The program has a function findFibonacci that calculates the Fibonacci value at a given position n.  The base cases are defined for n = 0 and n = 1.It checks if the entered value is a non-negative integer. If not, it displays an error message.  As a whole the script defines a recursive Fibonacci function , takes user input for the position in the Fibonacci series, validates the input, and then calculates and displays the corresponding Fibonacci value
