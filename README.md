### 1. Migration of Rings from plate A to plat B  using plate C as per specific conditions


##  1.2  install packages using '$npm install' or '$npm i'

## 1.3 program Logic

        This program implements Tower of Honoi algorithm to find the steps for moving diffrent diameter rings that is arranged in ascending order as per the diameter in plate A , it should be moved to plate B using plate C under specific conditions

        lower diameter should be placed over the higher diameter rings and should ne be placed vice versa.
        only one movement at a time

        The program logic is too depend son recursive function style
